# FAQ

This is a one stop page to find your answers to any organizational questions.

## I have a problem with my task. Where can I get some help?

1. Ask your group mates - someone may have already faced the same issue
1. Ask in the #questions chat. Either other students, or coaches will help
1. Visit the Office Hours call on Wednesday at 19:00 MSK. You can talk with coaches there

**Note**: If you know the answer to a question in the #questions channel - don't hesitate to respond! Beeing a part of engineering community is a part of being professional.


## How do I switch between lessons/main page/FAQ/course overview?

Each section is located in it's own branch. To switch to it you can use the branch picklist which is located right above the file list in the repo on the left


## There are 2 lessons in a week. In what order should I do them?

Unless one of the lessons explicitly sets another one as a pre-requisite, you can do them in  any order.

## What happens if I miss deadlines?

If you miss 2 deadlines simultaneously, you'll get kicked.

E.g.:
1. You miss Git-101 deadline and never finish the task
1. You miss the next lesson (Apex Basics 101) deadline

This gets you out of the course.

But:
1. You miss Git-101 deadline
1. You finish Git-101 after the deadline
1. You miss the next lesson (Apex Basics 101) deadline

That doesn't gets you kicked. In other words, if you hit 2 lesson deadlines one after another, then we'll have to revoke the course access.

**Note**: Things happen. If you understand you can't finish the task on time - reach out to any of the coaches. This won't count as an overdue/missed deadline.
